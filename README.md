Rest Spring Boot app

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [OpenJDK JDK 19.0.1 ](https://jdk.java.net/19/)
- [Maven 3.8.6](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in
the `com.mghr4937.demo.DemoApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use
the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
